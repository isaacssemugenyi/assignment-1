                As an aspiring developer who has just started coding or have
                little experience in software development, what often runs in
                your mind would be to get better and better and better and
                eventually start to apply for job opportunities, contribute to
                the open-source and build the next big thing but I would like to
                pose a question to you.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                How do we define better?
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                How can you determine that now you have gained enough experience
                to start applying for jobs and even start contributing to the
                open-source community?
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                When will the time reach to start building the next big thing?
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                When will that time come when you will fill you know enough in
                programming?
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                I got a privilege to interact with a senior developer and was
                fascinated by what I learned from him. He said you can't stop
                learning in a life of a programmer and every day presents a new
                challenge, this simply implies that if you don't move your self
                out there and start doing good with what you know already, then
                probably a perfect time to feel confident about your skills will
                never come, so being that every day presents its own and new
                challenge means you can't learn everything and you won't get to
                the point where you feel best, I argue you to go out there,
                contribute to the open-source community with the little you
                know, it might be as little as a pull request on a project,
                eventually, you will realize that you can provide more than what
                you thought you could.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                As the world advances, new needs and new normal come on board,
                every aspect of contribution to the world is essential and it's
                up to us to do the contribution in all aspects of life.
              </p>

                I am moved by the way a seed (bean seed) grows and finds the
                potential to go through the hustle of penetrating the ground in
                order to surface to the ground and grow to yield pods and more
                pods. I look at the tenderness of its stem when it grows out of
                the soil for the first time without any idea of how the outside
                looks like, but without any clue, it ends up growing even.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                I argue you as a developer to take the same courage, how fragile
                you might be at any moment, take the courage and expose what you
                know out there, apply for jobs opportunities out there and
                before you realize it, the world will appreciate you for it,
                will see your skills valuable and even provide you with job
                opportunities.
