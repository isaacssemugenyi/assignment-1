                      Permit me to talk about the the two different circles and their positive and negative 
                      impact on the daily livingÂ , growth and development of a software developer, often 
                      times we as human being tend to sink and be consumed by how people around us define 
                      and perceive us. This type of behaviour affects us so much that we tend to even forget 
                      ourselves and the potential we hold as people to develop and make a positive difference 
                      in our lives and the world at large.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                      When one as a developer, devotes most of his attention on how people around them 
                      perceive them and how they define them in all terms/ aspect of life, they end up 
                      forgetting the too much potential they have to change and better their lives as 
                      developers and even become influential and make a difference in the community they 
                      live in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                      The circle of Concern, revolves around what the everyone, your surrounding thinks 
                      of you, what they think is right and wrong to do or not, what they think everyone 
                      should do in the so called "normal life", when someone tries to deviate from what 
                      is considered as the normal, then everyone would criticize, comment and this as 
                      a fact often times influences the way one would think about a particular topic, 
                      plan or goal and then end up giving in to the normal that the surrounding has 
                      defined for you (this as a developer can hinder you from learning a new framework 
                      based on the perception of other about it, its not good enough, it does not do this
                       or that or even learn a new programming language). So you end up being consumed by 
                       the too much noise from the surrounding and the little voice inside you that says 
                       you can learn it, can do it, ends up being shadowed and eventually it dies out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                      However if you as a Developer resort to grow the Circle of Influence rather than 
                      the Circle of Concern, you decide to grow and push towards a set personal goal or 
                      achievement despite of what noise from the surrounding, you find that you end up 
                      doing a lot, achieving a lot than possible thought you could and end up being successful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text text-justify">
                      As I wind up this, developers who concentrate on the Circle of Influence 
                      (the circle within their means to control) end up being the proactive people who 
                      always see a possibility even in times of hardship and times of no way through 
                      and these are winners and not quitters. On the other hand, developers who concentrate 
                      on the Circle of Concern that most rather the Circle of Influence (circle outside 
                      their control) end up becoming overwhelmed by the pressure from the surrounding, 
                      giving up and failing and these are the reactive people.
                    </p>

                      <strong>
                        Therefore choose to concentrate on the Circle you have control over 
                        and you will move mountains, choose to be proactive and always see positivity 
                        as a possibility at all times.
