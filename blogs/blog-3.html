                Software development as a career path is filled with hopes of
                becoming the guy to build the next multi-million dollar
                application for every newbie in the software field. Often times
                new aspiring developers jump in with a lot of hopes just to
                achieve this, dive in the learning day in, day out. During the
                course of learning, developers then get sucked up by the already
                existing experienced developers with too much work experience, a
                lot of projects worked on and built. This starts to pose threats
                to the new developers and they start to doubt their potential,
                skills, and capability of what they can contribute to society.
                During the process of self-doubt, the introvert mind
                (personality) set in, this slowly by slowly consumes the
                aspiring developers from the inside, and what makes this a big
                threat is that these developers can't possibly get to know how
                good they are or have become.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                This mindset hinders them from expressing themselves in the
                anyway as developers but rather just sit down alongside
                experienced geeks and listen on how they brag and explain their
                experience with the different technologies they've worked with.
                Just to break out a little bit.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Let's review the human body, a human body on its own is a system
                with a couple of individual components put together to perform
                specific tasks and in the end, form a human system. However,
                when we look closely at the human system (body) few of these
                components are visible to the naked human eye.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                What we could term as the most important parts of the human
                system are actually hidden inside the human body. Back to the
                introvert point, a lot of developers have or are better on
                specific technologies and are at some extent even better than
                some of the developers they think are more experienced than them
                but they don't expose themselves to the potential chances where
                they can actually be identified and given a chance to do
                something good in the software sector, these developers end up
                leaving in the corners of their apartments, live miserable lives
                and quitting programming as a career.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Unless given an aid like an x-ray machine, ultra-sound, its when
                you can get to see some of these other components (organs) of
                the human body that perform in sync to learn the human system.
                So in the same context of software development, it would require
                a patient talent seeker or a friend to look deep inside an
                introvert developer to find out that he/she is actually a
                capable candidate for a particular software development task.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Who on earth would have this time to try and search into an
                introverted developer to find out how much you can do or add to
                a team?
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                I argue you to go out there, build a presentable profile from
                the many projects you have on Github, build a personal profile
                websites, attend community Developer groups, be present on
                social platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter to mention
                but a few, write about your experience on platforms like medium.
                Build a personal brand and let the world know you exist.
              </p>
