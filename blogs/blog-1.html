              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                In everyone's day to day life, we are presented with different
                challenges of life, however small or big the challenges of life
                may be, this makes us take different actions based on our own
                life setup. We at times find that we can treasure what we
                consider more important in our life, we can also consider what
                gives us the immediate pleasure or what gives us a quick success
                in life, also at time we prioritize what we can finish the
                fastest. However, these decisions that we make on a daily basis
                end up defining our whole life and we end up living by them.
                These in the end impact us as people either positively or
                negatively making us more successful and fulfilled or less
                successful and not fulfilled.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                This brings us to the Time Matrix, which defines how one
                specifically a programmer decides on how to spend their time,
                remember time waits for no one, the way one decides to spend
                their time becomes a key fact in how one's life will turn out to
                be in a lifetime.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                The Time Matrix talks about the 4 quadrants, where the first
                quadrant (Q1) specifies the "Important and Urgent" challenges
                and the second quadrant (Q2) specifies the "Important but Not
                Urgent" challenges, the third quadrant (Q1) specifies the "Not
                Important but Urgent" challenges and lastly the fourth quadrant
                (Q1) specifying "Not Important and Not Urgent" challenges. The
                four quadrants represent what we do on a daily basis and it
                entirely reflects how we make day to day decisions on doing
                this.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                By choosing a few examples to reflect on, in the first quadrant
                is where we like to do tasks at the rush hours when the
                deadlines are yet to be due, attend to urgent meetings and
                before we realize eventually we are totally worn out and can no
                longer be productive and effective, in the second quadrant is
                where we have a task that is important but not so urgent and has
                human beings and developers tend to ignore this quadrant for
                good yet it is within this quadrant that people develop a habit
                of daily practice that makes them more effective and move people
                mountains. In quadrant three lies our distractions, we consider
                these urgent but forget that they are not important at all,
                these carry along with the irrelevant meetings (unplanned) that
                take more time than they would take, attending to people's minor
                issues and unimportant emails, phone calls, commenting on posts
                on Facebook excessively and watching other people's status in
                times you would be doing something productive, in quadrant three
                and four we consume more time than we can possibly think as they
                are more relaxing and addictive in nature.

              <p class="card-text text-justify">
                Fight the temptation of submitting to Q1 and Q3, do away with Q4
                and concentrate on Q2, this is the source of success and role
                modeling. The quadrant of fulfillment and achievement of the
                personal mission statement.
